# MasterThesis
This repository contains the code for my master thesis and a digital copy of my thesis.

The Code folder contains a folder for every used language, which again contains a subfolder for each of the implemented patterns. 

For the thesis itself the relevant languages and patterns are:
Languages:
  C#, Python, Smalltalk, JavaScript and Go
Patterns:
  Adapter, Decorator, Composite and Prototype

For the Essay (A preliminary task, added as an appendix to the master thesis) the relevant languages and patterns are:
Languages:
  C#, Python, Smalltalk, JavaScript, Go, C++ and Java
Patterns:
  Factory, Observer
  
Note that the code is coded to be easily comparable between languages (for more information see Section 3.5 of the thesis), therefore it breaks some conventions regarding clean code,
